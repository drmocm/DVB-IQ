# DVB-IQ
a small example to show IQ data with libdddvb and DigitalDevices MAX SX8


You need to install the libdddvb library 

https://github.com/DigitalDevices/dddvb

and GTK 3.0 libraries as well as dvben50221.
(Tell me if I forgot any)

A typical example call would be:

./dvb_iq -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000

this visualizes the output you would get from:

ddzap -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000 -o

tuning parameters are for astra 28Â°E with my unicable setup and the lnb 
connected to the second input of my MAX SX8
