# DVB-IQ
small example programs in C and PYTHON to show IQ data with libdddvb and 
DigitalDevices MAX SX8

**For the C example**

You have to build dvb_iq with

`make` 

You need to install the libdddvb library 

https://github.com/DigitalDevices/dddvb

and GTK 3.0 libraries as well as dvben50221.
(Tell me if I forgot any)

A typical example call would be:

`./dvb_iq -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000` 

this visualizes the output you would get from: 

`ddzap -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000 -o` 

Additionally you can use dvb_iq with any program that gives you IQ symbols in
8bit integer format, e.g. with ddzap that would be:

`ddzap -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000 -o | ./dvb_iq` 


tuning parameters are for astra 28Â°E with my unicable setup and the lnb 
connected to the second input of my MAX SX8 with your LNB config file in
~/ddzapconf/


**For the PYTHON example**

Just use iqtk.py e.g. as follows:

`ddzap -d S2 -p v -f 10847000  -s 23000000  -c ~/ddzapconf/ -l64 -i 0x10000000 -o | ./iqtk.py`
